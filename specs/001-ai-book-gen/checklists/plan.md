**Purpose**: Validate implementation plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task generation
**Created**: 2025-11-26
**Feature**: [specs/001-ai-book-gen/plan.md](specs/001-ai-book-gen/plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Clear, concise summary of the plan.

- [x] Rationale for structure decisions is provided.
- [x] Documentation structure for the feature is accurate.

## Feasibility and Traceability

- [x] The plan directly addresses all functional requirements from the spec.
- [x] No new functional requirements are introduced without justification.
- [x] Technical approach is feasible within project constraints.
- [x] Key decisions and trade-offs are identified (if any significant ones exist at this stage).

## Readiness for Tasks

- [x] The plan provides enough detail to break down into actionable, independent tasks.
- [x] Potential risks or complex areas are highlighted for further breakdown.

## Notes
